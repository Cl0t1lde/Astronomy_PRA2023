The script makes the sinusoid fit for data of x-position of Jupiter's moon with their corresponding Unix time (found in the excel sheet). This will draw the moons' orbit as a funtion of time. It initiates the parameters by making initial guesses for the sinusoid. Both the name of the moon on line 14 and it's corresponding period of rotation on line 29 have to be manually changed by the user for each different moon. This results in a graph with the fit and all the important parameters.
